# Introduction to Python Preview Material for 2021 TechX

This preview material provide a self-study introduction to computing
with Python. They were originally developed for the computing course in Part
IA (Michaelmas Term) of the Engineering Tripos at University of
Cambridge, and adapted for the purpose of this event. 

The notebooks can be freely used, shared and modified. See the
copyright and license notice below.

# Installation and setup

All of the preview material are based on Jupyter Notebook, which is an open source 
web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain 
live code, equations, visualizations, and text. To setup Jupyter Notebook locally,
and therefore accessing the preview materials, please go install the correct version of 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your laptop.  

In the Anaconda Navigator, you should be able to launch Jupyter Notebook there.

Otherwise, you could open *Terminal* or *Power shell* on windows, and type the following command
```console
jupyter notebook .
```

Both would occupy a terminal session, and open a web browser and present the interface for Jupyter Notebook there.  
After all of that, navigate to the folder where the preview material resides, and you are good to go.
